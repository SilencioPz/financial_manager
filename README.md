<h1 style="font-family: serif; font-size: 18px;">Financial Manager SilencioPz</h1>

<p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">
  A project in Java that acts like an "Excel with buttons". 
  <br><br>
  A work in progress, I want to refactor the code as soon as I polish my knowledge about the language.
  <br><br>
  I also used JUnit, so I can have an auto-test and verify if the code is working properly in a specific Method present in the code.
